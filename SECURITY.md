## Known Security Considerations

### Workspace API Token
- The application requires a workspace API token with specific scopes
- Tokens are stored in environment variables or `.env` files
- Never log or display tokens in the application

### Rate Limiting
- The application handles workspace API rate limits automatically
- This prevents potential API abuse and account suspension

### Input Validation
- All user inputs are validated before processing
- Configuration files are validated for correct format and values

### File Permissions
- Configuration files should have appropriate permissions
- `.env` files should be readable only by the user running the application

## Security Features

### Built-in Protections
- **Skip List**: Protects important channels from accidental removal
- **Confirmation**: Double-confirmation for destructive actions
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API errors and rate limits
- **Input Validation**: Validation of all configuration and user inputs

### API Security
- **Rate Limiting**: Automatic handling of workspace API rate limits
- **Token Security**: Secure token storage and usage
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling without exposing sensitive information
